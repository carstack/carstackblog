      We are going Back to the future again.
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking at the 1981 photo, I am asking myself why does it look familiar? 
      To find out I did what a normal person would do. Google it.
      </p>
      <p>
      It turn out that it is the one and only “Back to the future” car. 
      That instantly took me to the good old days of my childhood. 
      I remember watching the Back to the future movies and getting excited about flying cars and hoverboards. 
      </p>
      <p>
      On their landing page https://delorean.com/, it says “THE FUTURE WAS NEVER PROMISED”. 
      </p>
      <p>
      What!!! Are they promising a flying time machine.
       May be not but the concept models look stunning, sleek and well designed. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Out of all concepts the one that caught my attention is the Alpha 5. 
      It really looks something from the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If you want to get one you will have to join the Alpha Club and book your production slot.

      <p>
      The Alpha 5 specs.

      </ul>
      <p>
      I know, it is exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
      I think the best part about the concept are the doors. Looks like a unicorn getting ready to fly.
      </p>
      <p>
      For the most part I think people would love to see something new like DeLorean in the EV market. The future is exciting indeed.
